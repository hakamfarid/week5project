# week5project
This repo was created for the assignment in week 4, getting and cleaning data

Codebook file describes what is contained in the dataset in order to understand the data easily
run_Analysis.R is a code file that when executed on the sensor data in your directory cleans the data and creates a tidy dataframe

The code works based on the 5 steps provided in the assignment handbook which are as follows:
1. Merge the training data and the test data
2. Extracts only measurements which contain the mean or the std deviation
3. Use descriptive names for the activities 
4. Appropriatly label the columns in the dataset 
5. Extract from the data another dataset which includes averages for each variable for each activity and each subject

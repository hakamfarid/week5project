Tidy data final text file is a dataset consisting of 180 rows and 82 columns containing an average value for each variable for each activity and subject.

The original data was obtained through waist worn Samsung devices using the internal accelorometers and gyroscopes in the device. Here is a link to where the data was obtained from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
From the original dataset, only the variables measuring some sort of mean or sandard deviation were kept.
The subject.txt file consists of a single column with subject IDs, data was collected on 30 subjects and so this data ranges from 1 to 30 
ActivityLables folder is a text file consisting of a key of activities and the corresponding IDs as follows:
1     WALKING
2     WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3     WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4     SITTING
5     STANDING
6     LAYING

features.txt folder consists of all the names of the variables that are measured, this was used as the column names for the Merged_Data dataset 

Other dataframes used with the code and are needed for the run_Analysis.R function are:
train/X_train.txt': Training set.
'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

These along with the subject test/train folders were all combined in the R code to use as one tidy dataset that is ready to use for data science projects
